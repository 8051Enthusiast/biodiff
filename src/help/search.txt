Search
======

There is a search box and an option how the search box is
interpreted.

The options mean following:
 * Text:
    the search query is interpreted as raw text (without
    any escapes) and searched.
 
 * Regex:
    the search query is interpreted as a regex. For more
    infos see https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/. Most
    normal regex is supported, backreferences are not.

 * Hexagex:
    Basically a regex, but basically written as if you are
    searching through hex. You can also use this to search
    normal hex, since there is nothing that could be
    accidentally escaped. For example, "([2-7].){5,}00"
    searches for zero-terminated ascii strings with five
    or more characters. You can also use text escapes through '\t'
    like "\t(Hello World)00" or search for bits by using I and O.
    The search query must always result in a multiple of 8 bits
    as a result.

You can use 'n' and 'N' to go forward/backward through the results.
