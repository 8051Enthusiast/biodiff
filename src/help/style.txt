Display Style Settings
======================

This window allows setting the way the binary is displayed.
While the settings are previewed directly, pressing Cancel
resets them to their previous state.

Vertical Split
--------------
Normally, the primary file is shown on the left and the secondary
one on the right. This option makes it so the split is vertical
and the primary file is on top and the secondary one on the
bottom.

Spacer
------
Inserts a space every 8 bytes in the main view (not the ascii view).

Right to Left
-------------
Instead of increasing the address from left to right, the opposite
is the case. This can be more natural for little-endian values,
since this mode shows them in the way that is consistent with
the order of the nibbles inside of the hex values.

Ascii Column
------------
Adds a column alongside the usual hex view which shows the
byte values as characters if they are in the ASCII range,
and else displays them as dots.

Bar Column
----------
Adds a column alongside the usual hex view which shows the
byte values as bars. The height of the bar is proportional
to the value of the byte.

Column Count
------------
Sets the number of hex columns. If there are more columns than
would fit on the screen, the rows are cut off so that the higher
addresses are not visible.
An empty value automatically sets the number of columns
to fit the screen.
A value with an x at the end means that the number of columns
is a multiple of the number before the x. For example, 16x means
that the number of columns is a multiple of 16 and is adjusted
to fit the screen.

Hex
---
The default, shows byte values always as their values in base 16.

Binary/Decimal/Octal
--------------------
Shows byte values as their values in base 2/10/8.

Hex/Ascii Mixed
---------------
Shows bytes in the printable ASCII range as characters.
Furthermore, also displays escape sequences \n, \r and \t.
Space is displayed as a dotted underline ("Ôπç").
If the byte does not match any of these criteria, it is displayed
as the hex value.

Note that the bytes in the ASCII range are displayed using
full-width unicode characters, which means that unicode support
is required.

Braille
-------
The bits of the byte values are mapped to dots. If the bits of
the original byte are numbered 0 to 7 from the least significant
bit to the most significant bit, it is mapped in the following
way to dots:
 ________
 | 7  3 |
 | 6  2 |
 | 5  1 |
 | 4  0 |
