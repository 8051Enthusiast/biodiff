Display Style Settings
======================

This window allows setting the way the binary is displayed.
While the settings are previewed directly, pressing Cancel
resets them to their previous state.

Ascii Column
------------
Adds a column alongside the usual hex view which shows the
byte values as characters if they are in the ASCII range,
and else displays them as dots.

Vertical Split
--------------
Normally, the primary file is shown on the left and the secondary
one on the right. This option makes it so the split is vertical
and the primary file is on top and the secondary one on the
bottom.

Hex
---
The default, shows byte values always as their values in base 16.

Binary/Decimal/Octal
--------------------
Shows byte values as their values in base 2/10/8.

Hex/Ascii Mixed
---------------
Shows bytes in the printable ASCII range as characters.
Furthermore, also displays escape sequences \n, \r and \t.
Space is displayed as two consecutive dots ("..").
If the byte does not match any of these criteria, it is displayed
as the hex value.

Note that the bytes in the ASCII range are displayed using
full-width unicode characters, which means that unicode support
is required.

Braille
-------
The bits of the byte values are mapped to dots. If the bits of
the original byte are numbered 0 to 7 from the least significant
bit to the most significant bit, it is mapped in the following
way to dots:
 ________
 | 7  3 |
 | 6  2 |
 | 5  1 |
 | 4  0 |
