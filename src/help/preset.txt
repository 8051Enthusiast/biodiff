Algorithm Presets
=================

In the algorithm presets window, you can create and edit
algorithm presets. Algorithm presets are a way to save the
settings of an algorithm so that you can easily switch
between them.

There are two columns labeled "Global Presets" and "Semiglobal
Presets". Global presets are used in the regular scenario
were you are just aligning the two files as a whole.
Semiglobal presets are used in the needle-in-the-haystack
scenario where one side of the view has a selection and
you want to find the best matching region in the other
side and start aligning from there.

You can create a new preset of either type by pressing the
"New Preset" button, and edit the currently selected preset
by pressing the "Edit Current" button. You are also able to
clone the currently selected preset by pressing "Edit Current",
renaming it and then pressing "New Preset".
