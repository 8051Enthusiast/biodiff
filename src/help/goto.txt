Goto
====

Put the address you want to go in (hexadecimal) into the address field.
Then you can either go to that address on the left/top side by clicking
'Goto Primary' or the same for the other view.

Note that for the unaligned view, in case you have the cursor activated
for a single view, the goto will only move that side (and you have to
click the corresponding goto button for that side too, otherwise you
will get an error).
