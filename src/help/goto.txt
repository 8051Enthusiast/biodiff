Goto

Put the address you want to go in (hexadecimal) into the address field.
The selected cursor(s) will jump to that address. You can select the
active cursor with a/s/d if the hexview is active.

If the input is of the form "01234567|89abcdef" (with a bar in the midle),
then the first view will jump to 01234567 and the second view will jump to
89abcdef.

If the aligned view is active, moving both cursors to given addresses will
only work if both addresses are aligned to the same location.
