Goto
====

Put the address you want to go in (hexadecimal) into the address field.
Then you can either go to that address on the left side by clicking
'Goto Left' or the same for the right view.

Note that for the unaligned view, in case you have the cursor activated
for a single view, the goto will only move that side (and you have to
click the corresponding goto button for that side too, otherwise you
will get an error).
