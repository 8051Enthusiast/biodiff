Set offset
==========

There are three options:
 * Align offset at start:
    Set the relative offset between the two files in the unaligned view
    so that they meet at their first byte and then jump to the start.
 
 * Align offset at end:
    Set the relative offset between the two files in the unaligned view
    so that they meet at their last byte and then jump to the end.
 
 * Align offset at biggest overlap:
    Set the relative offset between the two files in the unaligned view
    so that the amount of same bytes is maximal and then jump to a
    common subsequence where the product of entropy and length is the
    highest. This can be a bit faster than global alignment and is useful
    for initial exploration, but does not account for deleted/inserted bytes.
