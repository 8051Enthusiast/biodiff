* Add algorithm presets for saving multiple different algorithm settings and quickly switching between them

* Remove Local alignment option (old settings will be converted to Global)
* Remove `mmap` support
* Add warning on large alignment that may exhaust the memory
* Change blockwise aligment to start with a block centered around the current cursor, instead of independently aligning in each direction
* Change default style to use hex spacers
* Fix global alignment not keeping the cursor position
* Fix scrolling leaving a white trail on the right side on some terminals

==================
* Make bytes per row adjustable
* Add automatic determination of bytes per row based on data in view
* Redesign Goto menu
* Make address only use as many digits as necessary

* Add -v/--version flag
* Fix build failing because of SemVer-incompatible change in transitive dependency

1.0.3 (2022-07-22)
==================
* Fix hexagex bugs
* Fix blockwise align mode not showing the rest of the file when the other side of the file is already at the end/beginning
* Add BIODIFF_CONFIG_DIR env variable to set custom settings directory (MatejKafka)

1.0.1 (2022-03-05)
==================

* Add `git-biodiff` binary; this makes it possible to invoke biodiff when using git by using it as `git biodiff` the same way you would invoke `git diff`
* Fix crash when resizing terminal to very small size in vertical split mode
* Fix space bar doing page-down when the remainder of the files are the same instead of jumping to the end

0.2.0 (2021-06-26)
